A creative professional with a passion to solve problems with tech. With over 10+ years experience, I have dedicated myself to learning and adapting to new technologies and skillsets that have enabled me to maintain roles in design, development & consulting.

In recent years, I have honed into front-end development, pairing that with my respect for great design to craft memorable and accessible user experiences for all to enjoy.

In my spare time, I enjoy photography and creating [voxel art](https://www.instagram.com/hma.voxels).
